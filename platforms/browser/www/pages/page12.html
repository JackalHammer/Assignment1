                <h3>You go and talk to your boss. He takes a long look at you and says "You know I might forgive this if you hadn't this every saturday for the past month and a half. But you are consistently several hours late, and you are a terrible worker when you are here... You are fired". You turn around and walk out of the store. You take a seat on the sidewalk and sigh deeply to yourself. You say aloud "I should have just stayed in bed".</h3>
