            <h3>You march down the hall into the kitchen, but the walk is kinda difficult, it is making you dizzy. You don't quite make it to the fridge before you start to feel naseous. You are going to puke, and you don't know if you can make it to the washroom. The sink is right beside you, however it is filled with clean dishes (the dishes you have been telling your roommate to do forever. HE ACTUALLY DID THE DISHES!).</h3>
